## Arduino Music Visualizer
The Arduino Music Visualizer was made for ImagineRIT and is a sub-system of the overall project.
What this project entails is it uses the SparkFun Spectrum Shield to read the 7 band equalization.
The user can the select what frequency they would like to listen to using the UI system I built
for a oled screen that is wired to the board.  The user can then use one of the three buttons
that are built into the board to select it and the visualizer will recognize it and visualize 
it accordingly.

## What I learned
As someone who has never used Arduino or C++ before, this was a challenge that I was willing to take.  
There was a steep learning curve since this was programming to hardware so I had to understand the 
documentation and how to incorporate the necessary calls to make the code work.  In the end I learned
how to use Arduino and C++.

## The challenges I encountered
Some of the challenges were learning the C++ language since my background has mostly been in 
Java and Python.  Once I learned the functionality of C++, it became much easier.  The biggest
challenge that I encountered was making efficient memory usage from my code so the board
didn't run out of memory.  The last challenge I encountered was wiring up the acutal 
project and making sure everything worked properly and that it wasn't over using power 
from the power supply.
