## Arduino Music Visualizer
The Arduino Music Visualizer was made for ImagineRIT and is a sub-system of the overall project.
What this project entails is it uses the SparkFun Spectrum Shield to read the 7 band equalization.
The user can the select what frequency they would like to listen to using the UI system I built
for a oled screen that is wired to the board.  The user can then use one of the three buttons
that are built into the board to select it and the visualizer will recognize it and visualize 
it accordingly.
